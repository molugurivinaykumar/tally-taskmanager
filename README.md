## Project Description

### Project Overview:

The project is a responsive and dynamic task manager web application designed to manage and track tasks effectively. The web application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, and is designed to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on tasks.

### Objective & Business Scope:

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient task manager web application that can help users manage and prioritize their tasks effectively. The web application is designed to be simple and intuitive, enabling users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete with ease.

### Benefits for Users:

* Provides a central location to store and manage tasks.
* Helps users organize and prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.
* Enables users to easily track the progress of their tasks.
* Provides a reminder for upcoming tasks and deadlines.
* Facilitates collaboration between team members by sharing tasks and their status.

### Narrative of Key Steps:

The project started with planning and research to understand the user requirements and preferences. A wireframe was created for the web application's structure and layout. The HTML and CSS were used to build the web application's structure and styling, respectively. The web application includes a homepage, a task listing page, and a task detail page.

The task listing page displays all the tasks, including their title, description, status, and priority. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete. The task detail page includes a detailed description of the task, along with an option to edit or delete the task.

The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Best practices were followed throughout the development process, including the use of semantic HTML, proper code commenting, and testing for cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness. Finally, the web application was deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible to the public.
